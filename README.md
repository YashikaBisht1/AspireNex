# AspireNex
Task 1:Credit Card Fraud detection
Build a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Use a dataset containing information about credit
card transactions, and experiment with algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forests
to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.

Task 2:Spam SMS Detection
Build an AI model that can classify SMS messages as spam or legitimate.
Use techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifiers like Naive
Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector
Machines to identify spam messages

Based on the analysis of the provided notebooks, here is a proposed README for the "AspireNex" GitHub repository. This README includes sections for introduction, project structure, installation, usage, and more.

## Introduction

AspireNex is a collection of machine learning projects aimed at demonstrating the application of data science techniques to solve specific problems. Currently, the repository includes:

1. **Spam SMS Detection**: A project that aims to classify SMS messages as spam or not spam using various machine learning algorithms.
2. **Credit Card Fraud Detection**: A project focused on identifying fraudulent credit card transactions from a dataset of transactions.

## Project Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

## Installation

To run these projects locally, you will need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up your environment:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/YashikaBisht1/AspireNex.git
   cd AspireNex
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):

   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required packages**:

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Open the Jupyter notebooks to explore and run the projects:

1. **Spam SMS Detection**:

   Open `spam_sms_detection.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab and follow the instructions to run the code cells. This notebook will guide you through the process of loading the data, training the model, and evaluating its performance.

2. **Credit Card Fraud Detection**:

   Open `Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab and follow the instructions to run the code cells. This notebook will cover data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to enhance these projects! If you have suggestions for improvements or new projects to add, please create an issue or submit a pull request. Make sure to follow the repository's coding standards and guidelines.
